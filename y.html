  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brainstorming is a creativity technique that enables individuals and groups to generate a large number of ideas quickly. It encourages participants to think freely and suggest as many solutions as possible without criticism. This method is essential in engineering and innovation where generating diverse solutions is crucial to solving complex problems. Brainstorming fosters collaboration, enhances problem-solving, and leads to the development of innovative technologies and products. In academic and industry settings, brainstorming enables cross-functional teams to share unique perspectives, facilitating a broader understanding of challenges and the co-creation of inventive solutions. Furthermore, the process builds a culture of openness and experimentation, which is vital for long-term innovation. As the complexity of problems in engineering and technology continues to increase, methods like brainstorming become essential tools in harnessing the power of collective intelligence to create value-driven, scalable solutions. With the integration of digital tools and virtual collaboration platforms, brainstorming has become more accessible and inclusive, allowing global participation and idea diversity.</p>

    <h2>Types of Brainstorming</h2>
    <div class="types">
      <div class="type" onclick="toggleDetails('classic')">
        <strong>Classic Brainstorming</strong>
        <div id="classic" class="type-detail">Classic brainstorming involves gathering a group of people to discuss and generate ideas on a given topic. It's an open discussion where all participants are encouraged to speak freely, share suggestions, and build on each other's thoughts. The emphasis is on quantity over quality at first, which helps to stimulate creative thinking without the fear of judgment. This technique is widely used in engineering teams to tackle product design, troubleshooting, and process improvement challenges. Through classic brainstorming, participants often uncover unique insights that may not emerge in structured environments. This dynamic exchange of ideas fosters teamwork, speeds up innovation, and helps identify feasible strategies from a pool of raw concepts. Over time, the session is refined to prioritize and evaluate the most promising ideas for implementation.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="type" onclick="toggleDetails('brainwriting')">
        <strong>Brainwriting</strong>
        <div id="brainwriting" class="type-detail">Brainwriting is a silent form of brainstorming where participants write their ideas independently before sharing them with the group. This technique is effective for eliminating groupthink and allowing introverted participants to contribute more comfortably. Each person writes down their ideas and then passes the paper to another participant who adds their thoughts. This cycle continues, leading to a variety of creative perspectives and cross-pollination of concepts. Brainwriting is particularly useful when dealing with sensitive topics or when team dynamics may hinder open discussion. It ensures equal participation and can result in high-quality ideas that reflect individual creativity. By compiling and reviewing all written inputs, facilitators can identify recurring themes, innovative approaches, and unconventional solutions. It is a highly inclusive method and ensures that every voice is heard, regardless of their speaking style or confidence level.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="type" onclick="toggleDetails('mindmap')">
        <strong>Mind Mapping</strong>
        <div id="mindmap" class="type-detail">Mind mapping is a visual brainstorming technique that helps individuals and groups structure their thoughts around a central idea. Starting from a core concept, participants create branches representing categories, sub-topics, or related thoughts. This method promotes nonlinear thinking, making it easier to identify connections between ideas and generate new insights. Mind maps are especially helpful for organizing complex information and exploring a topic in depth. In engineering, mind mapping can aid in project planning, system design, and risk analysis. It leverages the brain's associative nature to trigger innovative thoughts and provides a clear overview of how ideas relate to one another. Digital tools like XMind or MindMeister can enhance this process with drag-and-drop features, real-time collaboration, and easy sharing. This structured yet flexible approach encourages creativity and improves memory retention.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="type" onclick="toggleDetails('scamper')">
        <strong>SCAMPER</strong>
        <div id="scamper" class="type-detail">SCAMPER is an acronym for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. It’s a structured brainstorming technique that encourages innovation by prompting users to view a product, process, or idea through different lenses. By applying each of the SCAMPER prompts, individuals or teams can uncover opportunities for improvement, innovation, or reinvention. For example, engineers redesigning a device might explore substituting one material for another, combining features to enhance functionality, or reversing the process for efficiency. This method encourages systematic creativity and helps break mental blocks. SCAMPER is widely used in product development, service design, and strategic planning. Its clear framework ensures comprehensive exploration of ideas and is especially effective when existing solutions need to be enhanced or reimagined. It’s a go-to technique for unlocking fresh perspectives and accelerating innovation in both startups and large organizations.</div>
